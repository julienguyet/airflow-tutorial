# airflow-tutorial
A Git Repository to demonstrate a simple data validation job using Airflow. If you would like to replicate this environment on your own machine, you can follow the steps below. 

## 1. Install Docker
The first thing to do is to install docker (if already installed, you can move to step 2).
Go to https://www.docker.com/get-started/ and follow the instructions based on your OS.

## 2. Install Astro
Now, we will install Astro which is an environment manager for Airflow and Docker. It will make our life easier by setting up the environment and managing the connection between Docker and Airflow.
Go to below link and follow instructions based on your OS. Once installation is finished move to step 3.
